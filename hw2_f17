Homework 2
-----------


Simulate the M/M/2/2+5 system (i.e. 2 servers with the common buffer of capacity 5) 
by means of discrete event simulation. Investigate the following two cases:
  * System A: arrival rate lambda=2, service rate of each server mu=1
  * System B: lambda=10, mu=1

1. (15%) Test your random number generator (RNG):
   1.1 Does your RNG generate random numbers?
   1.2 How do you initialize the seed of your RNG? 
   1.3 Generate two sequences of 1000000 numbers each, for every sequence use a different seed. 
       Are these two sequences different? How do you know this?    

2. (30%) Eliminate the warm-up period separately for each of the following cases by applying 
   the Welch graphical procedure:
   2.1 System A with the initial condition x(t=0)=0, i.e. the system is empty at t=0.
   2.2 System A with the initial condition x(t=0)=7, i.e. the system is full at t=0.
   2.3 System B with the initial condition x(t=0)=0, i.e. the system is empty at t=0.
   2.4 System B with the initial condition x(t=0)=4, i.e. there are 4 customers in the system at t=0.

   Change the seed of your RNG if you run multiple simulations to investigate a nonstationary state.


3. (45%) For the stationary regions of the Systems A and B identified in item (2) find: 
   3.1 Blocking probability.
   3.2 Mean time a customer spends in the system.
   3.3 Mean number of customers in the system.
   Find the confidence intervals for (3.1), (3.2) and (3.3). Assume the 90% confidence level. 

4. 10% credit will be given for the project report itself, i.e. its organization, clarity,
   nice and informative presentation of your results. 

 
 

Submission guidelines
---------------------

* Due date: Monday, Dec. 11, noon (Chicago time)

* Absolutely no late submissions. I must meet the grade posting deadline set by the Registrar 
  so late submissions will NOT be accepted. I give you as much time as I can.

* Your project report should include:
  - description of methodology used to solve the problem;
  - numerical results and their analysis;
  - observations/conclusions
  and
  - source code of your simulation program.

* Your submission should consist of two items ONLY, i.e. your project report + printout 
  of the source code used to obtain your results. All your results should be included
  in the project report. Do NOT submit a 1-page project report and 100 documents/files/attachments. 
  Such submissions will be disregarded.

* Note again that not only your results will be evaluated (see item (4) of the problem statement). 
  The format and organization of your report, and the way you express and communicate 
  your ideas (clarity, coherence, logical reasoning, conclusions) affect your grade as well.

* Absolutely no handwritten submissions.
      
* Teamwork is allowed and encouraged (max. 3 students/team). Individual submissions 
  are also OK.
 
* One submission per team only. Do NOT submit multiple copies of your project report 
  (I will penalize this). It's very confusing.

* Please put down your names (last, first, middle), student IDs, and section IDs (live, online, Bangalore) 
  on the front page of your project report. 

* Put a hard copy of your submission into my mailbox in the CS Dept. office
  or email a soft copy to me (project report in the PDF format ONLY + source code). 
  Live section: please submit a hard copy if you can.


Good luck!
